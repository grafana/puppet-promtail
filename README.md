## Description

[Promtail](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/master/docs/clients/promtail) is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki) instance or [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud). It is usually deployed to every machine that has applications needed to be monitored.

It primarily:

1. Discovers targets
2. Attaches labels to log streams
3. Pushes them to the Loki instance.

Currently, Promtail can tail logs from two sources: local log files and the systemd journal (on AMD64 machines only).

## Usage

The simplest way to get started with this module is to add `include promtail` to a manifest and create your config settings in Hiera. Additional details and examples are contained in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Reference

This module is documented via
`pdk bundle exec puppet strings generate --format markdown`.
Please see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for more info.

## Changelog

[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is generated prior to each release via
`pdk bundle exec rake changelog`. This process relies on labels that are applied to each pull request.

## Limitations

At the moment, this module only supports Linux. Future versions will support additional OS's including Windows.

## Development

Pull requests are welcome! A Vagrantfile is also included in this repository that can be used during development.
